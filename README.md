The Task List Application ensures the safety and security of your tasks, providing a reliable platform for organizing your data across various categories, such as:
- To-do
- Shopping List
- Personal
- Passwords
- Work
- Others

During the registration process, we collect users' email IDs for identification purposes. Google Firebase manages authentication using the provided email ID and password. It's important to note that we do not store users' passwords.

Your task data is stored securely in the Google Firebase database, with both the title and content encrypted to enhance protection. We prioritize user privacy and do not share any data with third parties.

For users who wish to discontinue using the application, there's a convenient account deletion feature accessible through the settings tab. It's crucial to be aware that once an account is deleted, data cannot be recovered. Your privacy and control over your information are our top priorities.
